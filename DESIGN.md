# oModel — a TUI to quickly set OMO models

> Brand **oModel** · command `omodel` · Python package `omodel` · repo `~/proj/oModel`
> Self-contained: a published Python package that needs **only Python + the `opencode` CLI** at runtime.

## Core idea (in one breath)

> **what omo suggests  +  what you already have  →  pick one  →  save a clean config.**

Per agent/category you see **omo's fallback chain, filtered to what you can actually run** —
each recommended model you have (exactly, or via a same-line substitute like glm-5 → glm-5.1),
resolved to a provider you're connected to. You make **one small decision** (pick a model), and oModel fills in
the fiddly parts for you: the correct `provider/` prefix and a valid `variant` (both overridable, and
it never blocks you — just ⚠-warns). See your options, choose, done. Everything below is just the
detail that makes those three steps reliable.

## Problem

`~/.config/opencode/oh-my-openagent.jsonc` sets a `model` (and optional `variant`) per **agent**
(sisyphus, hephaestus, oracle, …) and per **category** (deep, quick, writing, …), plus nested
sub-models like `sisyphus.ultrawork`. Today the file carries a big hand-curated palette of
**commented-out alternatives**; switching means hand-editing JSONC and remembering the right
`provider/` prefix and the right `variant`. That manual edit is the pain.

**Goal:** a TUI that, per agent/category, shows the current model and a candidate list built from
**what omo suggests** + **what you actually have** + **free text**, applies the correct provider
prefix and a valid variant, and saves a clean config.

## Runtime requirements

- **Python ≥ 3.9** (`importlib.resources.files`). Pin Textual to a release whose own
  `requires-python` ≤ our floor (verify at lock time, else bump floor to 3.10).
- **`opencode` CLI** on `PATH` — the source of "what you have". Degrades gracefully if missing or failing.
- **No** dependency on a local omo checkout or omo cache at runtime.
- **`bun`** (NOT node) is required **only** for the optional `omodel --refresh-omo` — see §Refresh.
  Verified: `node --experimental-strip-types` cannot run omo's modules (extensionless relative
  imports → `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`); bun resolves them.

## Decisions (locked)

| # | Decision | Choice |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Stack | Python ≥3.9 + **Textual**. Self-contained; no runtime coupling to omo source or cache. |
| 2 | Save format | **Edit-in-place**: only `agents`/`categories` are rewritten clean; **everything else — other keys, formatting, comments, commented-out config — is preserved byte-for-byte** (`render()` splices just those two spans). **Timestamped backup each save** (`.backup/<ts>.jsonc`). |
| 3 | Picker | **One pick list = the fallbackChain, filtered to models you have** (exact, else newest same-line `detect_family` substitute; unavailable entries hidden), **expanded to one row per serving provider — dedicated (single-vendor) before aggregator/gateway.** `enter` to pick (the row's prefix is what saves); a `+ add model…` row (`a`) types anything off-chain. Suggested variant. |
| 4 | Layout | **Two-pane list-detail**. |
| 5 | Availability flagging | **Invalid variant: warn but allow** (saves with ⚠). **Unavailable fallbackChain entries: hidden** from the pick list (decision #3) — a model you can't run isn't offered; a user-typed `+ add model…` that's unavailable still ⚠-warns and saves. |
| 6 | Agent coverage | **omo-specific only** (11 with requirements). |
| 7 | Categories | **omo's known set only** (8 with requirements). |
| 8 | Prefix rule | **Dedicated-first.** A provider is a *gateway* if its `opencode models` set spans ≥2 vendors; single-vendor providers are *dedicated*. The pick list shows **every** serving provider, **dedicated before gateway** (first-seen within each tier — `_ordered_providers`), so you choose the prefix by picking the row. (`resolve_prefix` still auto-prefixes a bare id typed in the add-model modal: `dedicated[0]`, else a gateway via `providers` order then first-seen.) |
| 9 | Suggestion data | **Bundled in the wheel** (`importlib.resources`); user-override dir supported. |
| 10 | Availability source | **Live `opencode models` CLI** — not omo's cache, **not `auth list`** (see §Data sources). |
| 11 | Refresh | `omodel --refresh-omo` regenerates the suggestion JSON via **bun** + an omo checkout. |
| 12 | Distribution | **GitHub-only** (no PyPI): PyInstaller binary + `install.sh` primary; `pipx`/`uvx` from git secondary. |
| 13 | First save | **Deletes the commented-out palette *inside* agents/categories** (those spans are rewritten clean); comments / commented-out config **outside** them are kept verbatim. The whole original is pinned verbatim as **`.backup/original.jsonc`** (never pruned). |
| 14 | Variant validity (pickers) | **opencode `--verbose` (cached) is the source of truth** for the add-model + `v` pickers (`Catalog.variants_for`): per-(provider, model) `variants` keys; prefer the first NON-EMPTY set across the picked provider then the gateway (dedicated providers report `{}`); empty everywhere / uncached → **offer nothing, no heuristic fallback** (kimi, glm-5 → no variant step). The bundled family registry stays the source for `detect_family`/substitution; the omo-suggestion ⚠ warn (`resolve._variant_warn`) **also** prefers `--verbose` now — the heuristic family `variants` is its fallback only when opencode is silent (dedicated `{}` / uncached) — but the registry is never the source for what the pickers offer. (Reverses the old "registry only, never `--verbose`" rule.) |
| 15 | Availability cache | opencode CLI output cached **24h** at `~/.cache/omodel/` (flat: `models.json`, `verbose-<prov>.json`); read-through in `catalog`. `r` / `--refresh-models` bust + rebuild it. Detail fetch is off the UI thread and **capped to one concurrent** (each opencode call is ~3s / ~320 MB). See §cache.py. |
| 16 | Undo | **In-session undo/redo of every edit** (`u` / `ctrl+r`) for mis-press recovery — a snapshot stack of cfg states (`history.py`), separate from the on-disk `.backup/` (decision #2). Each edit (set/clear/variant/add-model/add-sub/delete-sub) records a labelled snapshot; dirtiness is **computed** (`serialize(cfg)` vs last-saved text), so undo-to-saved reads clean. See §history.py. |

## Data sources

- **What you have (runtime):** parse `opencode models` → lines `provider/model` (split on the
  **first** `/`). Group → `available = {provider: [model_ids]}` (first-seen order); `connected =
  list(prefixes)` (first-seen order, never a set). Verified prefixes: `opencode deepseek
  moonshotai-cn openai zhipuai` (79 models today — count varies; tests must **not** hard-assert it).
  **Error rule (one definition, used by `catalog.load` too):** `opencode` not on `PATH` → banner +
  suggestions/add-model only; else exit code ≠ 0 **or** zero `provider/model` lines parsed → raise
  `CatalogUnavailable` → banner "couldn't read models", offer retry (`r`), degrade. (There is no other
  "partial" state.) `opencode models --refresh` is exposed as `omodel --refresh-models`, which also
  rebuilds the local cache (§cache.py).
- **Why not `opencode auth list`:** it prints provider **display names** ("Moonshot AI (China)", not
  `moonshotai-cn`) wrapped in box-drawing/ANSI with **no `--json`/plain flag** (verified) — fragile,
  and would need a name→ID map. `opencode models` already yields the usable provider set as clean IDs
  in one call (a provider appears only if it can serve models = exactly "usable"). oModel **never
  calls `auth list`**; `connected` (above) *is* the logged-in/usable set, shown as a `Providers:`
  header line. (`auth list`'s only extra info — api/oauth method, and providers logged-in-but-serving-
  zero-models — isn't needed for resolution or flags.)
- **Per-model detail (on demand):** `opencode models <provider> --verbose` emits, **per model**, a
  bare `provider/model` header line **followed by a multi-line pretty-printed (2-space) JSON block**
  (~80 lines, incl. a nested `variants` map). Parser: a header line matches
  `^(?P<prov>[a-z0-9_-]+)/(?P<model>\S+)$` at **column 0**; brace-count each following block and
  `json.loads` it. (Verified: bare `provider/model` strings never appear at column 0 *inside* a block
  — they're always quoted values — so brace-counting from each header is unambiguous.) Use
  `limit.context`, `cost.input/output` (may also carry `cost.cache.{read,write}`; free models show
  `$0`), `capabilities.reasoning`, `capabilities.input.image` for the **detail pane display only**.
  `--verbose.variants` (a per-model object whose KEYS are the variant names) **is** the variant source
  of truth for the model pickers (`Catalog.variants_for`, decision #14) — read it; `--verbose.family`
  is still **never** read (family stays heuristic). Caveat that shapes `variants_for`: the object is
  empty (`{}`) for the dedicated providers (zhipuai, moonshotai-cn) while populated by the gateway
  (opencode) and openai — so `variants_for` prefers the first NON-EMPTY set across the picked provider
  then others, treating `{}` as "ask another endpoint", and offers nothing only when it is empty
  everywhere (kimi) or uncached.
- **What omo suggests (bundled, build-time):** `omo-suggestions.json`, generated from
  `~/source/oh-my-openagent/packages/model-core/src/` (verified importable & serializable under bun:
  11 agents, 8 categories, 15 families, 9 variants). Schema the app **consumes**:
  ```json
  { "meta": {"omoVersion":"","omoCommit":"","generatedAt":""},
    "agents":   {"<name>": {"fallbackChain":[{"providers":[],"model":"","variant":""}], "variant":"",
                            "requiresProvider":[], "requiresModel":"", "requiresAnyModel":false}},
    "categories":{"<name>": {"fallbackChain":[], "variant":""}},
    "families": [{"family":"","pattern":"<RegExp.source|null>","includes":[],"variants":[],
                  "reasoningEfforts":[],"reasoningEffortAliases":{},"supportsThinking":false}],
    "knownVariants": ["low","medium","high","xhigh","max","minimal","none","auto","thinking"] }
  ```
  `requiresProvider`/`requiresModel`/`requiresAnyModel` are **carried but IGNORED** (they gate omo's
  auto-activation; oModel is a manual picker). `pattern` is stored as a string and `re.compile`d at
  load (negative-lookaheads like `k2(?![-.]?p\d)` verified to compile under Python `re`).
- **Your config (runtime):** `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/oh-my-openagent.jsonc` (fallback
  `~/.config/...`), `--config` override; scaffold a bundled starter if missing.

Each region is a bordered card; the **focused** pane's border brightens to `$primary`, blurred
panes use a muted gray (`#808080`, a literal — `$border-blurred` renders near-black on a dark
terminal). `Static#providers` / `Static#hints` are full-width bars (not cards), and
`Static#detail` is display-only — it shows the frame but never the focus highlight (Statics
never receive focus; only `#targets` and `#candidates` do).

**Color depth:** the CLI pins `TEXTUAL_COLOR_SYSTEM=256` (in `cli._default_color_system`, set
before `app` imports Textual) so the palette is consistent across terminals — a terminal with no
`$COLORTERM` and a bare `TERM=xterm` is otherwise auto-detected as only 16 colors and the UI
collapses to its ANSI slots, looking nothing like a `xterm-256color` session. Overridable:
`TEXTUAL_COLOR_SYSTEM=truecolor` for 24-bit, `=auto` to restore Textual's own detection.

The bottom hint bar (`Static#hints`) is **pane-aware** — it shows only the keys that act on the
focused pane + highlighted row, so it stays one line (left pane drops `enter set`/`v`/`x`; the
`+ add model…` row shows `enter add`; a category row drops `a sub`). `u undo` / `⌃r redo` are in
the shared global tail but shown **only when there's something to undo/redo**. See §Textual contract.

## Components

### Data contracts (shared shapes — fix once so `resolve.py` and `app.py` agree)
- `target` id (string): `"agent:<name>"`, `"agent:<name>.ultrawork"`, `"agent:<name>.compaction"`, or
  `"cat:<name>"` — identical to the §Textual `OptionList#targets` option IDs.
- `source` (string enum): `"omo"` (a `fallbackChain` entry — exact or same-line substitute) ·
  `"add"` (typed in the add-model modal). (`"mine"` retired — no connected-model dump.)
- **candidate row** — dict yielded by `candidates()` and rendered by `app.py`:
  ```python
  {
    "source":   "omo" | "add",
    "model":    "glm-5.1",                   # RESOLVED bare id actually used (the substitute,
                                             #   for a same-line stand-in), no prefix
    "provider": "zhipuai",                   # one serving provider; candidates() emits one
                                             #   ROW PER provider, dedicated-first (non-empty str)
    "variant":  "max" | None,                # per precedence; None = unset
    "entry":    {...} | None,                # the omo fallbackChain entry; None for 'add'
    "substitute_for": None | "glm-5",        # None = exact; else the omo id this same-line row fills
    "warn":     [] | ["variant"],            # 'omo' rows: variant only; 'add' rows may add "unavailable"
  }
  ```
  The value written to config is `f"{provider}/{model}"` plus `variant` (omitted when `None`).

### `catalog.py` — availability from `opencode`
- `load()`: `opencode models` → `available` (dict) + `connected` (**list**, first-seen order — never
  a set). Per the §Data sources error rule: exit code ≠ 0 **or** zero `provider/model` lines parsed →
  raise `CatalogUnavailable` (UI shows banner + retry); `opencode` not on `PATH` → empty + banner.
- `providers_for(model_id)` → connected providers that have it, in first-seen order.
- `detail(model_id)`: query `<provider>` = the model's **resolved** provider (first of
  `providers_for(model_id)`); run `opencode models <provider> --verbose`; split records on header
  lines `^(?P<prov>[a-z0-9_-]+)/(?P<model>\S+)$` (col 0), brace-count each block, `json.loads`, and
  pick the record whose header == `<provider>/<model_id>` → `{context, cost, reasoning, image}` for
  the detail pane (display only). This is a ~3s subprocess, so `app.py` calls it from a background
  worker (cached per model, debounced) — never on the UI thread (see §Textual two-pane contract).

### `cache.py` — on-disk opencode cache
- Both opencode subprocesses (`opencode models` ~3s, and `opencode models <prov> --verbose` ~3s /
  ~320 MB RSS) are cached **24h** under `~/.cache/omodel/` (`$OMODEL_CACHE_DIR` → `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/omodel`
  → `~/.cache/omodel`), **flat**: `models.json` + one `verbose-<provider>.json` per provider. Each file
  wraps stdout as `{version, fetched_at, args, stdout}` — explicit `fetched_at` (not mtime; survives
  copies) and a `version` that auto-invalidates on format change. Reads tolerate missing/corrupt/expired
  (→ miss); writes are atomic (`os.replace`) and swallow errors, so a non-writable cache never breaks the
  app. `clear()` removes only `*.json` (+ orphaned `*.tmp-*`), never foreign files.
- `catalog.load()`/`detail()` read through it (`use_cache=True`). opencode presence is checked **first**,
  so "not on `PATH` → empty" (above) is unchanged — the cache is a perf layer, not an availability
  fallback. A live, successful run rewrites the cache; every opencode call carries a `timeout=`.
- `catalog.refresh()` — the `r` key / `omodel --refresh-models` — runs `opencode models --refresh`
  (network re-fetch), clears the cache, and rewrites `models.json` from the result. The TUI runs it in a
  worker (off the UI thread); the `Providers:` header shows cache age (`cached 3h ago · r to refresh`).
- **Memory safety (load-bearing):** `asyncio.to_thread` threads can't be killed, so the detail fetch is
  **capped to one concurrent** (a `_detail_fetching` gate; on completion the worker re-renders the
  *current* target, which schedules the next — "chase the cursor"). Uncapped/un-stubbed, stacked
  ~320 MB `--verbose` processes OOM'd a machine; a refresh bumps a generation counter so an in-flight
  fetch discards its now-stale result. Tests stub `subprocess.run` and isolate the cache dir
  (`tests/conftest.py` → `$OMODEL_CACHE_DIR`).

### `suggestions.py` — bundled omo data
- Load order: `$OMODEL_SUGGESTIONS` → `$XDG_DATA_HOME/omodel/omo-suggestions.json` (from `--refresh-omo`)
  → bundled `importlib.resources.files("omodel.data")/"omo-suggestions.json"`.
- `detect_family(model_id)` — faithful port of `detectHeuristicModelFamily`: **ordered** iteration of
  `families`, `pattern` tested before `includes` within each entry, first match wins; run
  `normalize_model_id` first (`re.sub(r"\.(\d+)", r"-\1", s).lower()` → `kimi-k2.7`→`kimi-k2-7`).
  Patterns pre-`re.compile`d. (Parity matters: `openai-reasoning` before `gpt-5`, `kimi-thinking`
  before `kimi`, `claude-opus` before `claude-non-opus`.)
- **Entry shape retained:** each `fallbackChain` item keeps `{providers[], model, variant?, …}` — the
  `providers` array (omo's per-model preference order) is **kept** for the gateway tie-break in
  `resolve_prefix`.
- **`FAMILY_VENDOR` — hardcoded dict in `suggestions.py` (NOT from omo; omo has no such table).** The
  complete 15-family → vendor map used by `vendors_served`. The authoritative table is the
  `FAMILY_VENDOR` dict in `src/omodel/suggestions.py` — read it there; not duplicated here (it drifts).
  `vendor(family) = FAMILY_VENDOR.get(family)` → `None` for unknown/None. Models whose `detect_family`
  is `None` (opencode's `big-pickle`, `*-free`, `nemotron-*` — no omo family; note omo 4.13 added a
  `qwen` family, so `qwen3.x-plus` now detects `qwen`→`alibaba` and is no longer `None`)
  contribute **no** vendor and are skipped in `vendors_served`; **do not invent a family for them**.

### `resolve.py` — core logic
- **Gateway detection (`vendors_served`):** for each connected provider `p`,
  `vendors_served(p) = len({ vendor(detect_family(m)) for m in available[p] } - {None})` using the
  complete `FAMILY_VENDOR` map (§suggestions.py). `p` is a **gateway** iff `vendors_served(p) ≥ 2`,
  else **dedicated**; `gateways = {p for p in connected if vendors_served(p) >= 2}` is computed once at
  load. Data-driven, no hardcoded provider list — `opencode`/`openrouter`/`vercel`/`github-copilot`
  (and any future) self-classify; `openai`'s three families all map to vendor `openai` so it counts as
  **one** = dedicated. Verified live: `opencode`→8 vendors→gateway;
  `openai`/`zhipuai`/`moonshotai-cn`/`deepseek`→1→dedicated.
- **`resolve_prefix(model_id, source, entry=None)` (dedicated-first):** *mine* → its provider; else
  `cands = providers_for(model_id)`; `dedicated = [p for p in cands if p not in gateways]` → pick
  `dedicated[0]` (first-seen) if any; else only gateways serve it → walk `entry.providers` and pick
  the first **that is in `cands`**, else `cands[0]`. NB: `entry.providers` are omo-world IDs
  (`anthropic`, `github-copilot`, `vercel`, `zai-coding-plan`, …) that rarely intersect the user's
  `connected` set, so the `cands[0]` first-seen fallback is the common path; **both branches range over
  `providers_for` (availability IDs), never raw omo IDs**. `candidates()` no longer calls this — it
  lists *every* serving provider (`_ordered_providers`); `resolve_prefix` now only auto-prefixes a bare
  id typed in the add-model modal. Verified: `gpt-5.5`→`openai/…`,
  `claude-opus-4-7`→`opencode/…` (only gateway has it), `kimi-k2.5`→`moonshotai-cn/…`,
  `glm-5`→`zhipuai/…`. (`kimi-k2.5/2.6` and `glm-5/5.1` exist under both opencode and a dedicated
  provider — dedicated heads the list; add a second gateway like `openrouter` and it appears as just
  another row after the dedicated one.)
- **`_ordered_providers(model_id)` → list:** every connected provider serving the model, **dedicated
  (single-vendor) before aggregator/gateway**, first-seen within each tier (`[]` if none).
  `candidates()` emits one row per provider in this order — `glm-5` → `zhipuai/glm-5` then
  `opencode/glm-5`; `gpt-5.5` → `openai/gpt-5.5` then `opencode/gpt-5.5` — so the prefix is chosen by
  picking the row (no `p`-cycling).
- **`candidates(target)`:** one pick list — a single filtered pass over the `fallbackChain`, in
  chain (priority) order. For each entry: **(1) exact** — a connected provider serves the entry's
  model, tolerating `.`/`-` spelling and a trailing **date stamp / sub-version tag** (a provider's
  `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` or `claude-sonnet-4-8-jibao` fills the bare `claude-haiku-4-5` /
  `claude-sonnet-4-8`) → that **concrete available id** (`substitute_for=None`). A real modifier
  token omo itself uses (`mini`/`fast`/`nano`/`flash`/…, derived from the chain ids) is *not*
  stripped, and a short trailing digit stays a version (`glm-5.1` ≠ `glm-5`); **(2) same-line** —
  else the **newest connected model of the same `detect_family`** (version-agnostic: `glm-5` →
  `glm-5.1`; "newest" = highest digit-tuple, ties → first-seen) — except within the coarse
  `claude-non-opus` family (haiku, sonnet, fable, mythos, …) the substitute must also share the
  **product-line** token, so a haiku slot is never filled by a sonnet (nor a fable by a mythos) —
  (`substitute_for=<omo id>`); if that newest same-line model is itself an exactly-available chain
  entry, this entry is **skipped** (deferred to that model's own exact row) — never demoted to an
  *older* same-line model (so an unavailable `minimax-m3` resolves to the newest `minimax-m2.7` you
  have, not an older `minimax-m2.5`); **(3) else hidden** (neither exact nor same-line
  connected — a model you can't run isn't offered). Each entry id first passes through a hardcoded
  **omo-id alias** (`_OMO_MODEL_ALIASES`, oModel-only — omo has no such table): `k2p5` (a provider's
  dot-free spelling of kimi-k2.5) is treated as **exactly `kimi-k2.5`**, overriding omo's heuristic
  that would file the `p<digit>` suffix under the kimi-*thinking* family and pull in a kimi-k2-thinking
  model. The alias acts only here in `candidates()`; `detect_family`/`normalize_model_id` stay a
  faithful port. Each resolved model **expands to one row per serving provider** (dedicated-first,
  `_ordered_providers`); rows are then **deduped by resolved `provider/model`** (higher-priority
  entry/provider wins). **Variant precedence:** entry `variant` → requirement top-level
  `variant` → **none** (the family registry only *validates* variants — designates no default — so an
  unspecified variant stays unset; set one via `v`). (Top-level requirement `variant` is presently
  **always empty** in omo, so exercise that tier with a *synthetic* fixture, not a real ID.) Last row
  is `+ add model…` (`cand:add`) for off-chain picks; `enter` on any non-`add` row stages it. Flag:
  `⚠ variant` (variant unsupported for the row's (provider, model): checked against opencode
  `--verbose` when it lists a non-empty set, else the bundled family `variants`). (Unavailable entries
  are hidden, not flagged — decision #5.) **Current pick (`●`):** the row whose resolved
  `provider/model` equals the target's current assignment in `self.cfg` — at launch that's what
  `oh-my-openagent.jsonc` has on disk, and it follows your selection as you stage edits — is
  prefixed `● `; all other rows get a 2-space prefix. If the current model isn't in the (chain-only)
  list (an off-chain hand-pick — a custom model set in a prior session / by hand, or one that has
  dropped off the chain), `app.py` **surfaces it as its own row just before `+ add model…`** (built
  from `self.cfg`; ⚠-flagged `unavailable` only when the catalog is readable and the *assigned*
  provider doesn't serve the model — suppressed in degraded mode, where availability is unknown) so
  the configured model is always shown and re-selectable, and that row carries the `●` (see `_build_rows`). The
  picker proper stays chain-only; this single extra row is the current assignment, never a
  connected-model dump.
- **GPT-only agents (Hephaestus):** omo's `no-hephaestus-non-gpt` hook makes Hephaestus
  GPT-exclusive (`isGptModel` = model name after the last `/`, lowercased, contains "gpt"; a non-GPT
  model reassigns the session to Sisyphus). oModel mirrors this for `agent:hephaestus[.sub]`: the
  `+ add model…` row stays, but the add modal is **gated** — a non-GPT model is **blocked** (enter
  disabled, `⚠ Hephaestus is GPT-only`), so you can pick any GPT model you have but can't footgun a
  non-GPT one; the detail pane shows a `⚑ GPT-only` tip. Encoded as `_GPT_ONLY_AGENTS` +
  `_is_gpt_model` in `app.py` (matching omo's hard-coded agent key, not a data field — `requires*`
  are activation flags, not user-choice restrictions).

### `config_io.py` — edit-in-place save
- Read `json5.load` → ordered dict; `agents`/`categories` are editable, all other top-level keys
  (`claude_code`, `experimental`, `team_mode`, `$schema`, future) pass through. **The on-disk write
  is text-preserving (`render`, below): only the `agents`/`categories` value spans are rewritten;
  the rest of the file — other keys, formatting, and any comments / commented-out config *outside*
  those two (e.g. a `//"skills": false` line within `claude_code`, or a parked top-level block) — is
  kept byte-for-byte.** The commented palette *inside* agents/categories is still dropped (those
  spans are rewritten clean); only `.backup/original.jsonc` retains it.
- **`serialize(cfg) -> str` (exact):** the **canonical clean form** — used for dirtiness
  (`_is_dirty` = `serialize(cfg) != _saved_text`, both sides this function, never the on-disk bytes)
  and as the from-scratch / fallback writer; the actual on-disk write goes through `render`. (1) build an ordered dict preserving on-disk key order, but
  **force `$schema` to position 0** if present; (2) within `agents`/`categories`, a freshly-added
  sub-key (`ultrawork`/`compaction`) is **appended** to the end of its parent object, a cleared field
  is **deleted**; (3) `body = json.dumps(cfg, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)` — note `json.dumps`
  **cannot** emit comments, do not try; (4) return `"// Generated by oModel — edit via \`omodel\`\n"`
  `+ body + "\n"` (single trailing newline). Editable units: each agent's `model`/`variant`, its
  `ultrawork`/`compaction` `{model,variant}`; each category's `model`/`variant`. Example output head:
  ```jsonc
  // Generated by oModel — edit via `omodel`
  {
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/dev/assets/oh-my-opencode.schema.json",
    "agents": {
      "sisyphus": {
        "model": "moonshotai-cn/kimi-k2.5"
      }
    },
    "categories": {}
  }
  ```
- **`render(cfg, base_text) -> str` (the write form):** returns `base_text` with **only** the
  top-level `agents` and `categories` value spans replaced by their clean form (`json.dumps`,
  comment-free, `_clean_agents`-cleaned), re-indented under the key. Everything else splices through
  verbatim — comments, commented-out config, other keys, key order, formatting. A small JSONC-aware
  scanner (`_top_level_value_span`, honoring strings / `//` / `/* */` / nesting, so a `}` or
  `"agents"` inside a string never fools it) locates the two spans; the later span is replaced first
  so offsets stay valid. **Falls back to `serialize(cfg)`** when `base_text` is empty/blank or either
  key is not a direct root member (non-omo / hand-broken file — splice unsafe). `render` is
  **idempotent** (rendering its own output reproduces it byte-for-byte → an unchanged save is a
  no-op). It does **not** inject the `// Generated by oModel` header (that would touch outside
  agents/categories); the header is emitted only by the `serialize` from-scratch / fallback path.
- **Save flow:** diff `render(cfg, on-disk)` vs the on-disk file → confirm modal showing the diff
  (exactly what changes — agents/categories only, comments outside intact; the diff body is
  **scrollable** — ↑↓/`j``k`, PageUp/PageDown, Home/End — since a real config diff easily exceeds the
  modal's height, while the Yes button keeps focus so Enter still confirms) → on accept, snapshot the
  current on-disk file to `<config_dir>/.backup/<ts>.jsonc` (**verbatim byte copy** — preserves
  comments), then atomic temp+rename of `render(cfg, on-disk)`. No diff → "nothing to save".
- **Backups & rollback:** `<config_dir>/.backup/` (next to the config; `<config_dir>` = dir of the
  active config, default `~/.config/opencode/`). **Exact save order (this sequence):** (1) if
  `.backup/original.jsonc` does **not** exist, copy the current on-disk config to it (verbatim);
  (2) write the verbatim timestamped snapshot `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS[.mmm].jsonc` (UTC, sorts
  lexicographically; `.mmm` avoids same-second collisions); (3) prune **only** timestamped snapshots —
  `glob("[0-9]*.jsonc")`, which **excludes `original.jsonc`** — to the newest 20. So `original.jsonc`
  is written once, never overwritten, never pruned, and **never counts toward the 20** (your pristine
  pre-oModel palette). `omodel --restore` (and a TUI key) lists the **pinned `original.jsonc` + the
  newest 10** timestamped (each with timestamp + size / short diff); items 11–20 are an unlisted
  on-disk buffer. Restoring first snapshots the *current* file (so restore is itself undoable), then
  copies the chosen backup to the config path.
- ⚠ **First save drops the palette *inside* agents/categories:** the live config is comment-dense
  (3–6 commented alternatives per agent), and those live inside the `agents`/`categories` objects,
  which `render` rewrites clean — so the first save deletes that palette (decision #13). Comments /
  commented-out config **outside** those two are preserved verbatim. The whole pre-oModel file is
  also pinned as **`.backup/original.jsonc`** (never pruned, always restorable) — surface this in the
  first confirm modal.
- Missing config → scaffold oModel's own minimal `default-config.jsonc`, then open it. Template (the
  `$schema` is a **literal hardcoded string** committed in `default-config.jsonc`; nothing in the
  refresh path writes it):
  `{ "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent/dev/assets/oh-my-opencode.schema.json", "agents": {}, "categories": {} }`
  — valid and minimal; the left pane is populated from the bundled snapshot, so empty maps still show
  all 11 agents / 8 categories as unset, and only what you set gets written.

### `history.py` — in-session undo/redo (decision #16)
- **Purpose:** recover from a mis-press *within a session*, before/independent of saving — a
  wrong pick, a fat-fingered `x` (clear), an accidental `a` sub-target. This is distinct from
  the on-disk `.backup/` rollback (decision #2 / §config_io.py): that is cross-session file
  history (`--restore`); this is the live edit stack.
- **Model:** `History` holds a linear list of cfg **snapshots** with labels; a cursor marks the
  current one. Entry 0 is the loaded cfg. `push(state, label)` appends a deep copy (and is a
  **no-op when `state == current`**, so a re-pick of the same model makes no junk entry),
  truncating any redo tail first (standard undo semantics). `undo()`/`redo()` move the cursor
  and return `(state, label)`. Each entry also carries an optional **`aux`** companion snapshot
  (`push(state, label, aux=)`, read back via `current_aux()`) for state that must move with the
  entry but isn't cfg — app.py stores `_custom_rows` there; `clear_aux()` wipes it across all
  entries on a refresh. Change detection stays cfg-only (`aux` never on its own makes an entry).
  A `limit` (200) caps memory for long sessions. Snapshots are deep-copied **in and out** so the
  app's live cfg and history never alias. Pure data, no Textual — unit-tested in isolation.
- **App integration (`app.py`):** every cfg mutation routes through one chokepoint — `_record`
  (and `_stage_row`, which calls it) — so **set / clear / variant / add-model / add-sub /
  delete-sub** are all undoable. `u` → `action_undo`, `ctrl+r` → `action_redo` (vim-style; distinct from `r`
  refresh), both **gated to the base screen** via `check_action` (a modal owns its own keys —
  e.g. AddSubModal binds `u`). `_restore_state` swaps in the snapshot and re-renders **both**
  panes (a sub-target row appears/vanishes on the left; the `●` current-pick follows cfg on the
  right; a vanished sub-target falls back to its parent agent, repopulated via `_populate_targets(
  select=)` so no stale intermediate highlight fires). The per-target row cache is dropped and
  rebuilt (like a refresh); `_cand_choice`/`_detail_cache` are kept. `_custom_rows` (off-chain
  typed models, merged into `_build_rows`) is **snapshotted into the history alongside cfg** (each
  entry's `aux`, via `_record`) and restored here, so it moves in lockstep with undo/redo —
  **undoing an add-model drops its typed row** and redoing brings it back, not just the bare cfg
  value. A refresh still clears it (and the stored `aux` snapshots, via `clear_aux()`), since the
  stored availability ⚠ is now stale.
- **Dirtiness is computed, not flagged:** `_is_dirty()` = `serialize(cfg) != _saved_text` (the
  text last written/loaded). So undo back to the saved state quits without a prompt, and an
  empty `ultrawork`/`compaction` sub-object — which `serialize()` drops — is **undoable but not
  dirty** (nothing to save). The undo history is **preserved across a save** (re-baselines
  `_saved_text` only), so a just-saved edit can still be undone (then re-saved).

### `refresh.py` — `omodel --refresh-omo`
- Locate omo src: `--omo-src` | `$OMO_SRC` | `~/source/oh-my-openagent` (needs
  `packages/model-core/src`). Runner: **bun only** (no node fallback — verified broken).
- Run bundled `tools/snapshot_omo.ts` → JSON (RegExp→`.source`, Set→array, + `meta`).
- Write target: writable repo checkout (`src/omodel/data/`) → write there (maintainer commits);
  else `$XDG_DATA_HOME/omodel/omo-suggestions.json` (user override).
- Missing omo src or bun → **non-fatal**: print current bundled `meta`, keep bundled data.

### `tools/snapshot_omo.ts` — the extractor (bun, maintainer-time)
Real source: `src/omodel/tools/snapshot_omo.ts` — read it there; not inlined here (it drifts). Design
contract: at maintainer time it dynamically `import`s omo's `packages/model-core/src` modules
(`model-capability-heuristics`, `agent-model-requirements`, `category-model-requirements`,
`known-variants`) — **bun** resolves omo's extensionless `.ts`, node can't (see §Runtime requirements) —
and prints JSON matching the §Data sources "what omo suggests" schema: each RegExp `pattern` →
`.source` string (e.g. `claude(?:-\d+(?:-\d+)*)?-opus`), `Set` → array, plus a `meta` block
(`omoVersion` from omo's `package.json`, `omoCommit` from `git rev-parse`, `generatedAt`). `refresh.py`
runs `bun run <this file> <omo-src>` and writes stdout to the data file.

### Textual two-pane contract (`app.py`)
- **Header** `Static#providers`: one line `Providers: <id · id · …>` from `catalog.connected` in its
  **first-seen order** (per §Data sources; e.g. `opencode · deepseek · moonshotai-cn · openai ·
  zhipuai`) — so you see what's available at a glance; doubles as the
  ⚠-unavailable explainer ("no listed provider serves this"). When the list came from the 24h cache it
  also shows its age (`cached 3h ago · r to refresh`; see §cache.py). On `CatalogUnavailable` it shows
  the banner + `r` retry instead.
- **Left** `OptionList#targets`: AGENTS then CATEGORIES; option IDs `agent:<name>`,
  `agent:<name>.ultrawork` / `.compaction` (indented sub-rows, shown when present in config or added
  via `a`), `cat:<name>`. Sub-target set per agent = `{model}` ∪ present `{ultrawork, compaction}`.
  `compaction` is valid on every agent; `ultrawork` is **Sisyphus-only** (omo's `ultrawork`/`ulw`
  keyword swaps the model only on Sisyphus — on any other agent it's dead config omo never reads)
  (`_ULTRAWORK_AGENTS` / `_subkinds_for` in `app.py`, hard-coded like `_GPT_ONLY_AGENTS`). So only
  Sisyphus has a choice of sub-kind: `a` there opens a **chooser modal** (below) — naming each kind
  + what it's for rather than blindly cycling. Every other agent has the single kind `compaction`,
  so `a` adds it **directly** (no modal — there's nothing to choose).
- **Right**: `Static#detail` (current model/variant + `catalog.detail` line) and
  `OptionList#candidates` (IDs `cand:<i>`, last = `cand:add` — the `+ add model…` row). The `cand:<i>`
  row matching the current assignment (at launch the on-disk model; follows your pick) is prefixed
  `● ` (others `  `); an off-chain assignment not otherwise in the list gets its own `cand:<i>` row
  just before `cand:add` so it's shown + re-selectable (see §`resolve.py` "Current pick"). The **highlighted (cursor) row is remembered per target** — keyed by the row's
  `provider/model` identity, not its index — and restored on every re-render, so the cursor returns
  to your last position when you revisit a target **and after `r` refresh** (a refresh re-resolves
  the chain against new availability and reorders rows; identity-keying survives that, an index
  wouldn't). It's the one per-session cache a refresh deliberately does **not** clear. The `catalog.detail`
  line is a ~3s / ~320 MB subprocess, so it is fetched in a background worker (cached per model,
  debounced ~0.2s, and **capped to one fetch at a time** — §cache.py) and appears when ready; the rest
  of the pane renders instantly so highlighting is never blocked.
- **Hint bar** `Static#hints` (bottom row): **pane-aware** key hints — only the keys that do
  something for the focused pane + highlighted row, so it stays one line. Left/targets:
  `↑↓ move · → candidates · [a sub ·|a edit ·] [x delete ·] s save · q quit` (`a sub` on an agent
  row, `a edit` on a category row — categories have no sub-targets, so `a` opens the model modal
  there; `x delete` only on an ultrawork/compaction sub-target row).
  Right/candidates: `↑↓ move · ← targets · enter set · v variant · a edit · x clear · s save · q quit`
  (`x clear` becomes `x delete` on a sub-target row),
  or `… · enter add · …` on the `+ add model…` row. A shared global tail carries `u undo` / `⌃r redo`
  **only when there's something to undo/redo** (then `s save · q quit`), so the bar stays one line.
  Re-rendered on focus (`on_descendant_focus`) and highlight changes. Modals carry their own one-line
  hint (`Static.modal-hints`) instead.
  (`r` is intentionally absent from the hint bar — refresh is advertised in the `#providers`
  header instead — while `q quit` keeps its label since quit is surfaced nowhere else.)
- **Events:** highlight on `#targets` → repopulate detail+candidates for that target;
  `enter` on `#candidates` **dispatches by row**: on `cand:add` → open the add-model modal (below);
  on any other `cand:<i>` → set that model (+ default variant) on the in-memory target;
  `v` → push `OptionList` of the family's valid variants + `(none)`; `a` → pane-contextual: opens the
  add/edit-model modal (below) from #candidates **and** from a #targets *category* row (`enter` on
  `cand:add` also opens it), or adds a sub-target from a #targets *agent* row (chooser on Sisyphus,
  direct on every other agent — below); `x` → clear
  the assignment (on an ultrawork/compaction sub-target row → **delete the whole row**, parent agent
  regains focus — clear == delete since an empty sub-object serializes away);
  `u` → undo / `ctrl+r` → redo the last edit (in-session snapshot stack, §history.py — gated to the
  base screen via `check_action`, so they don't reach through a modal that binds `u` itself);
  `s` → diff+confirm save; `r` → refresh
  (off-thread `opencode models --refresh` + rebuild cache; also retries after `CatalogUnavailable`);
  `q` → quit (confirm if dirty); `←`/`→` → focus the targets / candidates pane (gated to the base
  screen via `check_action`, so it never grabs focus from under a modal; the add-model `Input` keeps
  its cursor arrows). **Vim aliases:** `h`/`l` mirror `←`/`→` (the *same* gated focus actions);
  `j`/`k` mirror `↓`/`↑` within whatever list is focused — bound on the `VimOptionList` every list
  uses (so they also work in the variant / add-sub modals), while a focused `Input` still takes
  `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` as literal text (printable keys reach a widget before its bindings). The vim keys
  are intentionally **absent from the hint bar** (it must stay one line). Pilot tests drive these via
  the stable IDs.
- **Add-model modal (`a` / `cand:add`):** a **two-phase** picker (IDs `#add-input`,
  `#add-candidates`, `#add-variants`, `#add-title`, `#add-preview`, `#add-hints`).
  **Model phase** — the `Input` (`#add-input`) fuzzy-filters `#add-candidates`, a list of the
  `provider/model` pairs you actually have (`catalog.available`), **dedicated-first** (single-vendor
  before gateway, then first-seen). The fuzzy engine is `textual.fuzzy.Matcher`, scored on the full
  `provider/model` string (so you can filter by either side). It is **type-to-search**: the modal
  opens with **no list** (the empty-query browse dump is intentionally not rendered — building/
  laying out every available pair, which a gateway can make hundreds, lagged the open), and the
  list appears only once you type. Results are capped (`_MAX_CANDIDATES`) so a broad one-letter
  query can't reintroduce that lag — type more to narrow. `Matcher("")` is never constructed (it
  raises). A typed query auto-highlights the top match for quick-select; with the list empty (right
  after opening, or a query that matches nothing) **nothing is staged**, so a reflexive `enter` is a
  no-op — you never commit a model you didn't choose. `↑`/`↓` (or emacs **`Ctrl-P`/`Ctrl-N`**) move
  the list while the `Input` keeps focus (driven from screen bindings; the list is `can_focus=False`).
  `Ctrl-P` is normally the App's *priority* command-palette binding, so `OModelApp.check_action`
  suppresses the palette while this modal is open (the only way to gate a priority binding — it is
  checked App-down before the key reaches the modal). **`Tab`** fills the highlighted
  pair into the `Input` (intercepted in `on_key`, before focus traversal); `enter` chooses the
  highlighted/staged pair, or — when the list is empty — the validated typed text; `esc` cancels. A full
  `provider/model` → used **verbatim** (split on the *first* `/`); a bare id → auto-prefixed via
  `resolve_prefix` **if available**, else `⚠ unknown — add a provider/` and `enter` is **blocked**; a
  typed full id that **fuzzy-matches nothing** appears as a synthetic **"use as typed"** row (so
  custom / `⚠ unavailable` ids still work — warn-but-allow, decision #5). A half-typed fragment that
  *still* fuzzy-matches (e.g. a Tab-filled id after a backspace — `zhipuai/glm-` ⊂ `zhipuai/glm-5`)
  falls back to those matches rather than leading with that ⚠-unavailable synth row. *(Trade-off:
  the synth row is offered **only** when nothing fuzzy-matches, so the rare custom id that is itself a
  subsequence of a longer available pair — e.g. `openrouter/claude` ⊂ `openrouter/anthropic-claude-…`
  — can't be committed as-typed; it shows the fuzzy matches instead. Accepted to kill the mid-edit
  footgun: a longer/distinct custom id is never a subsequence of a shorter available one, so the
  common "add a model I don't have yet" path is unaffected.)* A **GPT-only** target
  (Hephaestus) filters the list to GPT models and still blocks a typed non-GPT id.
  **Variant phase** — *iff* opencode reports variants for the chosen `(provider, model)`
  (`Catalog.variants_for` — the cached `--verbose` map, decision #14), `#add-variants` (a
  `VimOptionList`, IDs `var:<v>` / `var:__none__`) lets you pick one or `(none)` ⇒ `variant=None` (a
  *fresh add*, **not** `VariantModal`'s `''` clear sentinel); a model opencode lists with no variants
  (kimi, glm-5) — or whose verbose isn't cached anywhere — skips it and adds immediately. `esc`
  returns to the model phase. The post-hoc **`v` key** (`action_variant`/`VariantModal`) now reads the
  **same** `variants_for` source — the old `known_variants` "always offer *something*" fallback is
  **gone**; `v` on a model with no reported variants just **bells**. The result dismisses one
  candidate-row dict (`source` `"add"`); it's just another pickable row.
- **Add-sub (`a` on an agent):** an agent supports `compaction` always + `ultrawork` only on
  Sisyphus (`_subkinds_for`). Only Sisyphus has a *choice*, so only there does `a` open a **chooser
  modal**: an `OptionList` (`#sub-list`, IDs `sub:ultrawork` / `sub:compaction`) with one row per
  valid kind, each naming the kind + a one-line description of what omo uses it for (ultrawork =
  model swapped in on an `ultrawork`/`ulw` message; compaction = model for auto summaries). A kind
  already on the agent is **disabled** (`✓ added`); the `u`/`c` shortcut or `enter` picks one
  (→ empty sub-row, not dirty until a model is staged), `esc` cancels. **Every non-Sisyphus agent
  has the single kind `compaction`**, so `a` skips the modal and adds it **directly** — there's
  nothing to choose. Either way, every supported kind already present → `a` just bells (nothing to
  add). Replaces the old blind add-next cycle so the choice — and what each kind means — is explicit
  for newcomers, without making single-kind agents click through a one-option modal.

## Packaging & distribution (GitHub-only, no PyPI)

- `pyproject.toml` (hatchling, src-layout): `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel] packages =
  ["src/omodel"]`. The non-Python payload (`data/*.json`,`*.jsonc` + `tools/*.ts`) ships
  **automatically** because it lives under the package tree — do **NOT** add a `force-include`
  (it duplicates the path and fails the wheel build). `data/` and `tools/` each carry an
  `__init__.py` so they are **regular** packages: `importlib.resources.files("omodel.data" /
  "omodel.tools")` only resolves on a regular package under the **3.9** floor (namespace-package
  `files()` support landed in 3.10) — without it, every bundled-data read raises `TypeError:
  … not NoneType` on 3.9. `requires-python = ">=3.9"`; deps `textual` (pinned), `json5`. Entry
  point `[project.scripts] omodel = "omodel.cli:main"`.
- **Primary — standalone binary + installer (GitHub Releases):** PyInstaller **one-file** build,
  `pyinstaller --onefile --name omodel --collect-data omodel src/omodel/__main__.py` (bundles
  `data/` + `tools/`; `importlib.resources` reads them from the frozen package). CI `release.yml`
  builds on tag push (matrix: **linux-x64** `ubuntu-latest`, **darwin-arm64** `macos-latest`)
  and attaches `omodel-<os>-<arch>` (+ `.tar.gz`) to the Release. (Intel-mac `macos-13` was
  dropped — GitHub is retiring those runners and they queue for hours; Intel macs install via
  pipx.) `install.sh` detects OS/arch (`linux-x64`, `darwin-arm64`), downloads the matching
  asset, installs `omodel` to `~/.local/bin`:
  `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhoufanscut/oModel/main/install.sh | sh`.

  `uvx --from git+https://github.com/<you>/oModel omodel` ·
  `uv tool install git+https://github.com/<you>/oModel`.
- **Maintainer:** `git clone … && uv pip install -e .`; refresh data with
  `OMO_SRC=~/source/oh-my-openagent omodel --refresh-omo`, commit `src/omodel/data/omo-suggestions.json`;
  `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push --tags` → `release.yml` builds and publishes the binary.
- ⚠ **Licensing:** the bundled `omo-suggestions.json` is **data derived from omo source**, redistributed
  in both the repo and the binary. Confirm omo's `LICENSE.md`/`CLA.md`/`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` permit
  it and add attribution in `NOTICE`. `default-config.jsonc` is oModel's own (not copied) to avoid this.

## Verification (fixtures use REAL omo suggestion IDs)

1. **Build/install:** `pipx install .` (and `pipx install git+https://…` once pushed); `omodel
   --version`; `omodel --check` runs with no omo source. Then a PyInstaller one-file build → run the
   **binary's** `omodel --version`/`--check` to confirm bundled `data/` loads via `importlib.resources`;
   `install.sh` places it on PATH.
2. **Availability + prefix (unit, mocked `opencode models`):** `vendors_served` classifies
   `opencode`/`openrouter`→gateway and `openai`/`zhipuai`/`moonshotai-cn`/`deepseek`→dedicated.
   `providers_for("gpt-5.5") == ["opencode","openai"]` → list shows `openai/gpt-5.5` **then** `opencode/gpt-5.5` (dedicated-first);
   `claude-opus-4-7` → `["opencode"]` → `opencode/claude-opus-4-7`; `kimi-k2.5` →
   `moonshotai-cn/kimi-k2.5`; `glm-5` → `zhipuai/glm-5`. A chain entry with no connected provider and
   no same-line relative is **omitted** from `candidates()`; with only `glm-5.1` connected, the `glm-5`
   entry resolves to a `zhipuai/glm-5.1` substitute row (`substitute_for="glm-5"`). `glm + max` renders
   ⚠ variant but accepts. With `openrouter` also connected, a both-gateways-only model lists *both*
   gateway rows in first-seen order; `resolve_prefix` (add-modal single pick) still tie-breaks via
   `entry.providers`-then-first-seen.
3. **Verbose parsing (unit):** feed a captured multi-record `--verbose` blob → N records with
   `limit.context`/`cost`/`capabilities` extracted; confirm variant logic does NOT read it.
4. **detect_family parity:** `kimi-k2.5`→`kimi` (no `max`), `k2p5`→`kimi-thinking`, `claude-opus-4-7`
   →`claude-opus` (has `max`), `gpt-5.5`→`gpt-5` (`xhigh`), `glm-5`→`glm` (no `max`),
   `deepseek-v4-pro`→`deepseek` (has `max`).
5. **Bundled suggestions:** `importlib.resources` loads with no omo checkout; 11 agents, 8 categories.
6. **Refresh:** checkout + `OMO_SRC` + bun → rewrites data file (meta bumped); no omo/bun → non-fatal.
7. **Headless UI (Pilot):** select `agent:sisyphus`, set `cand:*` → `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`, `s`,
   confirm → re-`json5.load`: model updated, `team_mode`/`experimental`/`claude_code` unchanged by
   value, the palette *inside* agents/categories gone but comments *outside* them preserved verbatim,
   a `.backup/<ts>.jsonc` snapshot exists (verbatim original); a second
   save adds a second snapshot and `--restore` lists them newest-first.
8. **Live:** machine with `opencode`, no omo source → `omodel` launches, lists from `opencode models`,
   edits + saves a clean file OMO reloads.

## Execution playbook (team fan-out)

When ready to build, fan out as **6 specialists + a lead**, contract-first (model tier = "Safety").
**Launch trigger:** the user says "go" (say "lean" to drop the QA agent → 5; "cost-lean" to re-tier
Config/TUI to Haiku).

### Roster
| Role | Owns | Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Lead / Integrator** | §Data contracts + module signatures; repo scaffold; generate real bundled data (`snapshot_omo.ts`→`omo-suggestions.json`) + `default-config.jsonc`; wire `app.py`↔modules; final integration | **Opus** |
| **Core logic** | `catalog.py` · `suggestions.py` (detect_family, FAMILY_VENDOR) · `resolve.py` · `tools/snapshot_omo.ts` | **Sonnet** |
| **Config I/O** | `config_io.py` (serialize, backups/restore, scaffold) | **Sonnet** |
| **TUI** | `app.py` two-pane + variant/add-model/diff modals + keybindings | **Opus** |
| **CLI + packaging** | `cli.py` · `refresh.py` · `pyproject.toml` · `install.sh` · `.github/workflows/*` · README/LICENSE/NOTICE | **Sonnet** |
| **QA / verification** | all 5 `tests/test_*` authored **from this spec, independent of the implementations** + runs the 8 §Verification checks as the **merge gate** | **Sonnet** |

### Sequencing (contract-first)
0. **Lead (blocking):** freeze §Data contracts (`target` id, `source` enum, candidate-row dict) + each
   module's public signatures; scaffold the repo (`pyproject`, package dirs, stub modules); generate the
   real `omo-suggestions.json` (bun + omo checkout) and hand-write `default-config.jsonc`. Unblocks all.
1. **Fan out in parallel (isolated git worktrees):** Core, Config, TUI, CLI+packaging, QA each in their
   own worktree against the frozen interfaces. QA writes tests from the spec + stable widget IDs in
   parallel (not blocked on implementations).
2. **Integrate (lead):** merge tracks, wire `app.py` to catalog/suggestions/resolve/config_io, reconcile
   any interface drift against the §Data contracts.
3. **Gate (QA + lead):** QA's `test_*` green **and** all 8 §Verification checks pass (incl. a live
   `opencode` run + a Pilot save round-trip). Nothing ships until green.

### Notes
- **Integration risk concentrates at `app.py`** (it consumes all four modules); the §Data-contracts
  block is what lets it be built in parallel against frozen shapes. Lead owns final wiring.
- **Dependencies:** `resolve.py` → `suggestions.py` + `catalog.py`; `refresh.py` → `snapshot_omo.ts`.
  `config_io.py` and CLI+packaging are near-independent; everything else parallelizes once contracts
  are frozen.
